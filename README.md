# Responsive Calculator
* Idea from [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com/courses/foundations/lessons/calculator).
* [Live preview](https://ndmekala.github.io/calculator/).
* Clone of the iOS calculator.
* In desktop mode it *looks like* youâ€™re looking at phone. In mobile mode, youâ€™re *actually* looking at a phone. ðŸ™ƒ
* I feature this project in my [portfolio](https://www.meka.la).
